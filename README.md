Peer-to-peer Remote Control Protocol resistant to shutdown and detection at the network level.

## Goal
Demonstrate that every network detection system is doomed to failure.

Eventually the project will expand to demonstrating that every endpoint security solution is doomed to failure by creating a similar scheme but for file and runtime detection resistance.

This is currently very much of a work in progress, but once more functional, I challenge you to create programs that can detect the network flow between a bridge and a peer without making use of a whitelist. Create an issue and I will study it to further improve the project.
